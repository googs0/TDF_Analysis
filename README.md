<br>

* Please note that the code is tailored to analyzing specific Tour de France data and may need adjustments if you want to apply it to a different source

- Usage:
  - Import CSV data into DataFrame for analysis
  - Preprocess data inclyding feature extraction and data cleaning
  - Perform time series analysis on stage distances over the years
  - Apply predictive modeling techniques to predict stage winners based on features like year, distance, and stage type
  - Conduct hypothesis testing to compare to average stage distances between decades of Tour de France races
  - Enhance functionality as needed for specific use case
- External libraries: fbprophet, matplotlib, pandas, pydrive, plotly.express, scikit-learn, scipy
